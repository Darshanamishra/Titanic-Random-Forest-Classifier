# Welcome to the Titanic Survival Prediction project!

This project is a machine learning initiative where we utilize the Random Forest algorithm to predict which passengers on the Titanic were likely to survive the tragic event.

### Overview
The Titanic dataset is a classic problem for data scientists, often used to demonstrate various data analysis and machine learning techniques. In this project, we explore the dataset, clean the data, engineer features, and develop a predictive model to determine the survival of passengers.

### Why Random Forest?
We selected the Random Forest model due to its robustness in handling datasets where features might not have strong correlations with the target variable. The Titanic dataset is a great example of this, where many factors—such as age, gender, and class—contribute to survival outcomes. The Random Forest model allows us to leverage the majority of these useful features effectively.

### Project Goals
Data Exploration: Understanding the key features of the Titanic dataset.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and preparing it for modeling.
Model Development: Training a Random Forest model to predict passenger survival.
Evaluation: Assessing model performance using various metrics.
Deployment: Making predictions and saving the trained model for future use.
How to Explore the Project
If you're interested in exploring the project, here's how you can get started:

Data Exploration: Start by reviewing the data exploration notebook. This will give you insights into the dataset and the key features that influence survival.

Model Training: Move to the model training notebook to see how the Random Forest model is developed. You can follow along with the code, experiment with different hyperparameters, and see how the model performs.

Making Predictions: Use the trained model to predict the test dataset. You can also explore how the model can be improved further.
